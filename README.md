# Sentiment Analysis of Covid-19 Tweets
The Covid-19 pandemic has caused a surge in social media engagement, particularly on platforms like Twitter, where individuals express their opinions. Sentiment analysis of these tweets can provide valuable insights into public perception, assisting policymakers and stakeholders in their decision-making process. This project investigates the effectiveness of different feature representation methods in sentiment analysis of Covid-19 tweets, using a Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC), and it compares these outcomes with those from a fine-tuned RoBERTa model incorporating contextual embeddings. The analysis, conducted on a dataset of 44,926 manually labeled tweets, accounted for class imbalances using evaluation metrics including the F1 score and PR AUC score. A baseline Linear SVC model using Bag-of-Words was compared to other four Linear SVC models employing Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (Tf-Idf), Word2Vec, FastText, and GloVe. The RoBERTa model emerged as the superior performer, achieving an F1 score of 0.86 and a PR AUC score of 0.91, which underscores the potency of contextual embeddings in discerning social media language subtleties. Interestingly, the simple count-based Linear SVC model performed better than the models using static word embeddings. These results emphasize the importance of choosing appropriate feature representation techniques for sentiment analysis tasks, especially when analyzing pandemic-related social media data.
